<body>
<p>There are several kinds of links</p>
<ul>
	<li>absolute links</li>
	<li>relative links</li>
	<li>internal links</li>
	<li>graphical links</li>
</ul>
<div id= "absolute">
<h1>Absolute Links</h1>
<p>These are links that takes a user to a page owned by another person. It essentially says "hey how about you go to this page if this is what you're looking for"</p>
<p> An example is this link that will take me to FUTO website</p>
<p>The need for a university focused on technology was clearer by then hence the birth of <a href= "http://futo.edu.ng" target= "_blank"> FUTO</a></p>
<p>When we click on FUTO we are taken to a different page. The target attribute "blank" makes the browser open the page in a different tab, in its absence the new page would open in the same tab.</p></div>
<div id= "relative">
<h1>Relative Links</h1>
<p>Relative links are links that are used to connect different pages owned by one user. This is ideal when one is creating his own website. The developer can link his different webpages with a relative link. an example would be if i wanted to link this page with the page that talks about Alte.</p></div>
<p> Louis talks about alte's rising stars in his new <a href= "firstPage.html" target= "_blank">article</a></p>
<div id= "graphical">
<h1> Graphical Links</h1>
<p>The links we've spoken about are similar in the sense that we click on a text that takes us to a different webpage. Graphical links are different in the sense that they take us to a different page when we click on an image or icon. An example would be when you click on a facebook icon and find yourself in the facebook webpage. We will make the image below a graphical link
	<a href= "http://kanyewest.com" target= "_blank">
	 <img src= "https://media.newyorker.com/photos/5cbe1c19ee7eb330b45d554c/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Tolentino-KanyeSundayService-1.jpg"  width= "50%" alt = "Kanye Omari West"></a></p></div>
<div id= "embedded">
	<h1>Embedded Links</h1>
	<p>These are links that are used to find navigate a page. It takes you to a specified location in your page. The page must have divs with id attributes to let the browser know the specific part of the page one needs.</p></div>
